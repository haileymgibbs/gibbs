# Hi there, I'm Hailey.

## About

My name is Hailey Gibbs. I'm a child development researcher, currently working with Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek on the expansion of Playful Learning Landscapes and related research with national and international collaborators. I received my Ph.D. in Human Development from the University of Maryland under the supervision of Dr. Lucas Payne Butler. 

My research focuses on the role that questions play in childrenâ€™s interactions with their peers and caregivers in supporting their understanding of the relation between evidence and knowledge-building. I am also broadly interested in the features of learning environments that best support kids' scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. I'm interested in doing work with a community-based, equity mindset, with the goal of expanding early social and educational experiences to all children (and both in and out of school).

## Research

Question-Asking | Generic Language | Trust in Testimony | Play as Learning | Science and Information Literacy

Children gain information from the work through active exploration. But they are also highly attuned to the things that other people tell them, about all sorts of topics: social customs, object labels, physical phenomena.

They ask questions in order to elicit specific types of information and understand that some people probably have more specified types of knowledge than other people (e.g., doctors are more likely to know about medicine and pilots are more likely to know about airplanes).

But in relying on other people for information, we are also faced with a serious epistemological challenge: how do we figure out which people and what information to trust? How do we know when knowledge is justified, and whether someone has come about it in a reliable way? How do our environments (physical and social) shape the kind of information we have access to?

## Teaching

Learning is a kind of science, and the same critical skills that researchers cultivate in the course of their work are those that will best enable students to engage in the course of their learning - the capacity to make connections across multiple different domains, to delve into new problems with the ability to ask good-quality questions, to recruit the necessary information to answer those questions, and ultimately to build reliable knowledge structures.

**In the service of this idea, I strive to:**

1) Reinforce the idea that students are central co-constructors of their own knowledge (not passive recipients of static, established knowledge). 

2) Centralize the many ways in which People of Color are overlooked and sometimes exploited in Psychology and Human Development, among other social sciences, with an emphasis on realizing the contributions of marginalized populations to modern science.

3) Encourage students to think of learning/science in terms of process, not product.

4) Help students become critical consumers of information - and responsible portrayers of it (build a strong foundation in oral and written communication).

## Writing

One of my passions is writing about interesting things for people who want to read about them.
I've published in The Conversation and in the Science and Philosophy publication on Medium.
